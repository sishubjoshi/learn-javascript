## My Javascript learning journey


> ## Things I learned:
  * Object Oriented Javascript( classes, objects, prototype, prototypal inheritance)
  * Asynchronous Javascript ( AJAX, JSON, working with API's ..... )
  * Error Handling and Regular Expressions
  
  
  
  ## Projects:
  * To-do App
  * Number Guesser
  * OOP BookList( Similar to the To-do app but using OOP concepts
  * Github Finder(simple search app using Github API [here](https://github.com/sishubjoshi/Github-Search)
